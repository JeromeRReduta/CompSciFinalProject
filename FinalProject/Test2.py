# Notes so far
''' Why can't append several classes to badguys?

badguys is a list of coordinates

appending coordinates to badguys

We are changing coordinates of bunnies and blitting each bunny to coordinates

So when we put a class in a list, we can't change them like we can coordinates

Potential Solutions:
1) Revamp Bunny Class - give spawn coordinates, and in move function change them
THEN make a bunnies list and fill that list with Bunny() classes
THEN make a for loop and make each one move

Would need to find out how things get blitted to a ceratin location (check Bunny())

2) Leave as is'''
